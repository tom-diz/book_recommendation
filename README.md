# Final Project: Book Recommendation Platform
## Course: Introduction to Python

### Description

Completed in late 2021.

This project was developed for a first-year engineering student assignment at EFREI Paris. The objective is to provide users with a "recommendation" platform, allowing them to input their opinions on certain books (manually addable). These opinions help users receive recommendations based on the reading preferences of others.

### Installation Guide

#### Python Installation
To use this project, Python3.x is mandatory. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/).

#### Required Package Installation
It's essential to install the **numpy** package for the proper execution of some program functionalities.

**Method 1:** In PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (Linux), type the command: `py -m pip install numpy`

**Method 2:** If the above command doesn't work, try: `pip3 install numpy` or `py -m pip install numpy` or `py -m pip3 install numpy`.
If the installation is successful, a message like this should appear: `Successfully installed numpy-1.21.4`.

#### Running the Program
Download the source code from the GitHub repository, unzip the file, and using the Python console or by double-clicking, execute the `main.py` file. If everything works correctly, the main menu will appear.
